# cs162assignment4

I just remember being told that these are super duper important.

anyways this is a doubly linked list assignment that is supposed to be a queue for a mock mp3 playr

when loading from a text file use "songs.txt" or "Text.txt". only the "songs" with the shorter file paths will be deleted properly. 

* issues

- delete function dosn't compare song names properly if the songPTH is too long. 


* note:
I know that this is not a proper implementation of an actual queue since things arent really deleted from the front but they are searched and picked out by filename. This is the finctionality that my professor wants this thing to have.
